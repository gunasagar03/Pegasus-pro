🧭 How to Use (Step by Step)
Connect via USB and authorize the device on first use.
Launch Pegasus: python3 pegasus.py.
Start with [1] Check Device to verify connection and view info.
To use Wi‑Fi ADB:
Keep USB connected once, choose [2] Connect a Device.
Script will switch ADB to TCP/IP on port 5555 and ask for your phone’s IP.
Enter IP (example: 192.168.1.42) → it will run adb connect <ip>:5555.
You can now disconnect USB and continue wirelessly.
Use other options as needed (record screen, mirror, screenshot, list APKs, etc.).
When done, choose [3] Disconnect Device or simply close the program.
